        Somewhere Coffee Co. began as a small coffee cart on the corner of 28th and 3rd street. As the lines 
        began to grow, we thought "why not open a coffee shop?" and expanded into our current location. The rest 
        is Somewhere in history. We have been in the coffee business for 8 years and are masters at our craft. We 
        select only the finest beans to go into our blends and strive for excellence in customer satisfaction. We 
        offer quiet nooks for sipping and reading your favorite book, catching up with old friends or simply 
        enjoying a cup outside and watching the world go by.</br>
        Whatever your coffee conundrum commands, find it at Somewhere
