Dear Ms.Giang,

Today, I write this letter to for you who is my teacher at the center PMP English. I have a lot of things want express to you. Before starting to learn at PMP, I am really unconfident about my English level and I really don't know myself can do speak and write English or not? Because I have rarely communicated in English even though I have learned a lot of at school, it seem that there is not a favorable environment that can create conditions for me to practice speaking and writing skill. Since learning at class SP-WR38 of Ms.Giang, I have a good environment to practice speak and write skill. Morever I received enthusiastic supports and helps from my classmates and Mr.Giang. I am truly grateful for the experiences that PMP center and Ms. Giang have brought to me while learning here.

I always spend time to see the reviews of her for my homework and learn from experience to improve speaking and writing skill of myself. Finally, thanh you again for your contributions to the class and wish you always have good health to work and devote yourself to helping young people like us improve our English level.

Sincerely

Phan Trọng Tính
